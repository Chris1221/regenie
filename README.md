**regenie** is a C++ program for whole genome regression modelling of large [genome-wide association studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study).

It is developed and supported by a team of scientists at the Regeneron Genetics Center.

The method has the following properties

- It works on quantitative and binary traits, including binary traits with unbalanced case-control ratios
- It can process multiple phenotypes at once
- It is fast and memory efficient ðŸ”¥
- For binary traits it supports Firth logistic regression and an SPA test
- It supports the [BGEN](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/bgen_format/), [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats#bed) bed/bim/fam and [PLINK2](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0/formats#pgen) pgen/pvar/psam genetic data formats
- It is ideally suited for implementation in [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) (see [GLOW](https://projectglow.io/))

## Version history
Version 1.0.5.3 (Use cxxopts header-only library to parse command line arguments; changed program options `--p/--c/--b/--o/--1` to `--phenoFile/--covarFile/--bsize/--out/--cc12`, respectively; added options `--lowmem-prefix/--pThresh`)

Version 1.0.5.2 (Changed default behavior to remove individuals who have missing data at all phenotypes in the analysis; absolute paths are written in the predictions list file created in step 1)

Version 1.0.5.1 (Reduced memory usage and computational time when using options to keep/remove genotyped samples from the analysis)

Version 1.0.4.2 (Fixed bug excluding/including variants in step 1 with PGEN input format and improved the implementation of how it's done)

Version 1.0.4.1 (Can specify multiple phenotypes/covariates/chromosomes using comma separated arguments; chromosome names can start with 'chr' in the input genotype file)

Version 1.0.4 (Enabled PLINK 2.0 PGEN format files as input using the PLINK 2.0 PGEN library)

Version 1.0.3 (fixed genotype coding in dominant/recessive test for BGEN input format)

Version 1.0.2 (fixed numerical overflow bug when using option `--chr` in step 2; changed to boost split function to read all input files [either space/tab delimited])

Version 1.0.1 (fixed numerical overflow bug for quantile calculation; added new strategy for fitting null model for approximate Firth test) 

Version 1.0 (22 June 2020): Initial release
